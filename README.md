# ExpenseTracker
Expense Tracker is a system to maintain your expenses in a structured manner. You can add new expenses, view all expenses an delete ane expense(s) you want. It has been developed using vanilla javascript, and for frontend, HTML and CSS has been used. It consists of 2 main files, form.html and view.html, both in a folder named Expense Tracker. 

In form.html, there are some fields which user needs to enter like amount, category(dropdown) and description. Then when the user clicks the submit button, the data is saved in local storage. Then there is another button which is labeled as view expenses, which on click, leads to view.html.

In view.html, there is a button Add new expense, which leads back to form.html. Below it is total amount shown of all expenses. After that, all the data of expenses is available in a tabular form including id, amount, category, description and a button to delete, which deletes the expense after user confirms the deletion in a popup. And below the table are multiple buttons for filters to sort/view expenses as needed.

To run the application, download the folder, open it on vs code, and simply press F5 or the option to run from navbar.
